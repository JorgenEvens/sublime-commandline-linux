sublime-commandline-linux
=========================

This plugin works around a somewhat annoying issue when using the commandline on linux to launch Sublime Text 2 in a specific folder.

When you would `sublime folder`, 2 windows would appear, your previous session and the new one.
This plugin closes the old one for you.
